# Uselless box
 Useless box for fun and no profit.
 
 This useless box was inspired by [this](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1258082) project by [grafalex](https://www.thingiverse.com/grafalex/designs).
 
 Credit for model of the servo goes to [jimmi henry](https://grabcad.com/library/5-gram-servo-1). Many thanks!

 In this project I did not like that is hold in one piece by screws and it is using 9V battery so I started to model my own parts and finished with completely new useless box. IÂ´m using Arduino code and servo arm in my box. Many thanks to **grafalex** that he provided his project with STEP file. 
 
 For this project you will need following items: 
 
 - 3D printer or somebody who has one (or more)
 - Arduino Nano
 - 5g servo
 - battery holder for 2* 18650 batteries
 - 2 pcs of 18650 battery
 - 8 pcs of M2x6 screws
 - power switch (slide type)
 - power switch (that one on top)
 - soldering iron, some solder, some wires, etc.
 
I printed all of the parts from **PLA**. Most of them in **0,3 mm layer** height, but you can choose what ever layer height you want. I used 10% infill and no other special settings. 
I recommend print "**_top_lid.stl_**" piece with **0,15 mm** height and drill holes for screws with 2 mm drill.

If you will need any detail from my box, pls create issue and I will try to help you ASAP. 

Enjoy building of your box and keep trying to win!
